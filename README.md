# Efficient Implementations of Post Quantum Cryptographic Schemes Based on Plain Lattices
___

## Introduction

Shorâ€™s algorithm for quantum computers, enables us to solve Integer Factorization problems and Discrete Logarithm Problems in polynomial time. This jeopardizes the current public key schemes such as RSA, Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Therefore, we want secure cryptosystems under quantum computing for classical computers. One of the promising solutions for this is lattice-based cryptographic schemes with the Learning with Errors(LWE) problem. 

The aim of the project is implementing acryptographic scheme based on plain lattices and LWE principles which are resistent to attacks from quantum based computers.
